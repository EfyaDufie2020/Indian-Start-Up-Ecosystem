# Indian-Start-Up-Ecosystem



My goal is to explore the datasets and derive key insights that will serve as a springboard for investors to venture into the rapidly growing start-up ecosystem in India. By analyzing funding data from 2018 to 2021, I aim to identify critical factors such as the amount of funding received, sectors, stage of investment, investors, geographical location, and other promising opportunities. My analysis is conducted using the CRISP-DM process.

##### Introduction

The Indian start-up ecosystem is a thriving hub of innovation and entrepreneurship. This project aims to provide key insights into the ecosystem by analyzing data on funding, sectors, investment stages, top investors and geographical locations.



##### Objectives

1. To analyze the funding data trends of Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021.
2. To identify key sectors and stages of investment.
3. To understand the geographical distribution of start-ups.
4. To highlight promising opportunities for investors.
5. To use the CRISP-DM process for structured data analysis.




##### Data Sources

Data on start-up funding, sectors, stages of investment, and geographical locations was connected from a server and one drive.
